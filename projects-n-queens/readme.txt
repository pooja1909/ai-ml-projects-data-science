#Vivek Patani - B551 - Assignment 0

##Instructions about running the code:
The code accepts arguments in the order:  
- Selection of Mode: N Queens or N Rooks problem (1 means N Queens and 2 means N Rooks)  
- Number of Queens or Rooks (basically value of N)  

### N Rooks Execution command
timeout 1m python answer.py 2 523  

### N Queens Execution command
timeout 1m python answer.py 1 15  

###Special Instructions:  
There are two switches to get successor2() to work:  
1.) I've placed and commented them in the solve function and in the very bottom of the python file.  
2.) Just switch them to False for getting the original code with question 3 modifications.
