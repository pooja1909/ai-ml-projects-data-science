alberteinstein near the beginning of his career einstein thought that newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field  this led to the development of his special theory of relativity he realized however that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916 he published a paper on the general theory of relativity he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light  in 1917 einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole he escaped from nazi germany in 1933 where he had been a professor at the berlin academy of sciences and settled in the us becoming a citizen in 1940  on the eve of world war ii he helped alert president franklin d roosevelt that germany might be developing an atomic weapon and recommended that the us begin nuclear research  that research begun by a newlyestablished manhattan project resulted in the us becoming the first and only country to possess nuclear weapons during the war he taught physics at the institute for advanced study at princeton new jersey until his death in 1955 einstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 nonscientific works and received honorary doctorate degrees in science medicine and philosophy from many european and american universities his great intelligence and originality has made the word einstein synonymous with genius albert einstein was born in ulm in the kingdom of wrttemberg in the german empire on 14march 1879  his father was hermann einstein a salesman and engineer  his mother was pauline einstein ne koch in 1880 the family moved to munich where his father and his uncle founded elektrotechnische fabrik j einstein  cie a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current the einsteins were nonobservant jews their son attended a catholic elementary school from the age of five until ten  although einstein had early speech difficulties he was a top student in elementary school his father once showed him a pocket compass einstein realized that there must be something causing the needle to move despite the apparent empty space  as he grew einstein built models and mechanical devices for fun and began to show a talent for mathematics  talmud was a poor jewish medical student from poland the jewish community arranged for talmud to take meals with the einsteins each week on thursdays for six years  during this time talmud wholeheartedly guided einstein through many secular educational interests in 1894 his fathers company failed direct current dc lost the war of currents to alternating current ac in search of business the einstein family moved to italy first to milan and then a few months later to pavia when the family moved to pavia einstein stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium see dealberteinsteingymnasium mnchen his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering but einstein clashed with authorities and resented the schools regimen and teaching method he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning  in the spring of 1895 he withdrew to join his family in pavia convincing the school to let him go by using a doctors note einstein applied directly to the eidgenssische polytechnische schule eth in zurich switzerland lacking the requisite matura certificate he took an entrance examination which he failed although he got exceptional marks in mathematics and physics the einsteins sent albert to aarau in northern switzerland to finish secondary school  in aarau einstein studied maxwells electromagnetic theory  at age 17 he graduated and with his fathers approval renounced his citizenship in the german kingdom of wrttemberg to avoid military service and in 1896 he enrolled in the four year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the polytechnic in zurich marie winteler moved to olsberg switzerland for a teaching post einsteins future wife mileva mari also enrolled at the polytechnic that same year the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course  over the next few years einstein and maris friendship developed into romance and they read books together on extracurricular physics in which einstein was taking an increasing interest  in 1900 einstein was awarded the zurich polytechnic teaching diploma but mari failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component theory of functions  there have been claims that mari collaborated with einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions in early 1902 einstein and mileva mari had a daughter they named lieserl in their correspondence who was born in novi sad where maris parents lived  her full name is not known and her fate is uncertain after 1903 einstein and mari married in january 1903  in may 1904 the couples first son hans albert einstein was born in bern switzerland their second son eduard was born in zurich in july 1910  in 1914 einstein moved to berlin while his wife remained in zurich with their sons  mari and einstein divorced on 14 february 1919 having lived apart for five years einstein married elsa lwenthal ne einstein on 2 june 1919 after having had a relationship with her since 1912  she was his first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally  in 1933 they emigrated permanently to the united states in 1935 elsa einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems and died in december 1936 after graduating einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post but a former classmates father helped him secure a job in bern at the federal office for intellectual property the patent office as an assistant examiner he evaluated patent applications for electromagnetic devices  in 1903 einsteins position at the swiss patent office became permanent although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electricalmechanical synchronization of time two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time with a few friends he met in bern einstein started a small discussion group selfmockingly named the olympia academy which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy  their readings included the works of henri poincar ernst mach and david hume which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook in 1901 einstein had a paper on the capillary forces of a straw published in the prestigious annalen der physik by 1908 he was recognized as a leading scientist and he was appointed lecturer at the university of berne the following year he quit the patent office and the lectureship to take the position of physics docent at the university of zurich he became a full professor at karlferdinand university in prague in 1911  in 1914 he returned to germany after being appointed director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics 19141932 and a professor at the humboldt university of berlin although with a special clause in his contract that freed him from most teaching obligations he became a member of the prussian academy of sciences in 1916 einstein was appointed president of the german physical society 19161918 in 1911 he had calculated that based on his new theory of general relativity light from another star would be bent by the suns gravity  that prediction was claimed confirmed by observations made by a british expedition led by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of may 29 1919  international media reports of this made einstein world famous  on 7 november 1919 the leading british newspaper the times printed a banner headline that read  revolution in science new theory of the universe newtonian ideas overthrown much later questions were raised whether the measurements were accurate enough to support einsteins theory in 1921 einstein was awarded the nobel prize in physics because relativity was still considered somewhat controversial it was officially bestowed for his explanation of the photoelectric effect he also received the copley medal from the royal society in 1925 einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921  when asked where he got his scientific ideas einstein explained that he believed scientific work best proceeds from an examination of physical reality and a search for underlying axioms with consistent explanations that apply in all instances and avoid contradicting each other he also recommended theories with visualizable results in 1922 he traveled throughout asia and later to palestine as part of a sixmonth excursion and speaking tour  his travels included singapore ceylon and japan where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese his first lecture in tokyo lasted four hours after which he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace where thousands came to watch  einstein later gave his impressions of the japanese in a letter to his sons308 on his return voyage he also visited palestine for twelve days in what would become his only visit to that region he was greeted with great british pomp as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist writes isaacson this included a cannon salute upon his arrival at the residence of the british high commissioner sir herbert samuel during one reception given to him the building was stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him  in einsteins talk to the audience he expressed his happiness over the event in 1933 einstein decided to immigrate to the united states due to the rise to power of the nazis under germanys new chancellor adolf hitler while visiting american universities in april 1933 he learned that the new german government had passed a law barring jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities a month later the nazi book burnings occurred with einsteins works being among those burnt and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaimed jewish intellectualism is dead  einstein also learned that his name was on a list of assassination targets with a 5000 bounty on his head  one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase not yet hanged other german scientists fled as well among them fourteen nobel laureates and twentysix of the sixty professors of theoretical physics in the country  other scientists who left germany or the countries it came to dominate included edward teller niels bohr enrico fermi otto stern victor weisskopf hans bethe and lise meitner many of whom played a large part in the allies developing nuclear weapons before the nazis he took up a position at the institute for advanced study at princeton new jersey in the summer of 1939 a few months before the beginning of world war ii einstein was persuaded to write a letter to president franklin d roosevelt and warn him that nazi germany might be developing an atomic bomb the letter dictated by einstein british columnist ambrose evanspritchard notes however that washington at first brushed off with disbelief the fears they expressed he then describes how quickly roosevelt changed his mind gosling adds that the president was a man of considerable action once he had chosen a direction and believed that the us could not take the risk of allowing hitler to possess nuclear bombs  other weapons historians agree that the letter was arguably the key stimulus for the us adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the us entry into world war ii as a result of einsteins letter and his meetings with roosevelt the us entered the race to develop the bomb first drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources it became the only country to develop an atomic bomb during world war ii as a result of its manhattan project however according to historian fritz stern for einstein war was a disease and he called for resistance to war but in 1933 after hitler assumed full power in germany he renounced pacifism altogether  in fact he urged the western powers to prepare themselves against another german onslaught einstein became an american citizen in 1940  not long after settling into his career at princeton he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe according to isaacson he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers and as result the individual was encouraged to be more creative a trait he valued from his own early education  einstein writes as a member of the naacp at princeton who campaigned for the civil rights of african americans einstein corresponded with civil rights activist w e b du bois and in 1946 einstein called racism americas worst disease he later stated race prejudice has unfortunately become an american tradition which is uncritically handed down from one generation to the next the only remedies are enlightenment and education after the death of israels first president chaim weizmann in november 1952 prime minister david bengurion offered einstein the position of president of israel a mostly ceremonial post the offer was presented by israels ambassador in washington abba eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons on april 17 1955 albert einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by dr rudolph nissen in 1948  he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live long enough to complete it  einstein refused surgery saying  i want to go when i want it is tasteless to prolong life artificially i have done my share it is time to go i will do it elegantly einsteins remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location during the autopsy the pathologist of princeton hospital thomas stoltz harvey removed einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family in hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent  in his lecture at einsteins memorial nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of him as a person throughout his life einstein published hundreds of books and articles  most were about physics but a few expressed leftist political opinions about pacifism socialism and zionism einsteins early papers all come from attempts to demonstrate that atoms exist and have a finite nonzero size  at the time of his first paper in 1902 it was not yet completely accepted by physicists that atoms were real even though chemists had good evidence ever since antoine lavoisiers work a century earlier the reason physicists were skeptical was because no 19th century theory could fully explain the properties of matter from the properties of atoms ludwig boltzmann was a leading 19th century atomist physicist who had struggled for years to gain acceptance for atoms  boltzmann had given an interpretation of the laws of thermodynamics suggesting that the law of entropy increase is statistical  in boltzmanns way of thinking the entropy is the logarithm of the number of ways a system could be configured inside the reason the entropy goes up is only because it is more likely for a system to go from a special state with only a few possible internal configurations to a more generic state with many  while boltzmanns statistical interpretation of entropy is universally accepted today and einstein believed it at the turn of the 20th century it was a minority position the statistical idea was most successful in explaining the properties of gases  james clerk maxwell another leading atomist had found the distribution of velocities of atoms in a gas and derived the surprising result that the viscosity of a gas should be independent of density  intuitively the friction in a gas would seem to go to zero as the density goes to zero but this is not so because the mean free path of atoms becomes large at low densities a subsequent experiment by maxwell and his wife confirmed this surprising prediction  other experiments on gases and vacuum using a rotating slitted drum showed that atoms in a gas had velocities distributed according to maxwells distribution law in addition to these successes there were also inconsistencies  maxwell noted that at cold temperatures atomic theory predicted specific heats that are too large  in classical statistical mechanics every springlike motion has thermal energy kbt on average at temperature t so that the specific heat of every spring is boltzmanns constant kb a monatomic solid with n atoms can be thought of as n little balls representing n atoms attached to each other in a box grid with 3n springs so the specific heat of every solid is 3nkb a result which became known as the dulongpetit law  this law is true at room temperature but not for colder temperatures  at temperatures near zero the specific heat goes to zero similarly a gas made up of a molecule with two atoms can be thought of as two balls on a spring  this spring has energy kbt at high temperatures and should contribute an extra kb to the specific heat it does at temperatures of about 1000 degrees but at lower temperature this contribution disappears  at zero temperature all other contributions to the specific heat from rotations and vibrations also disappear  this behavior was inconsistent with classical physics the most glaring inconsistency was in the theory of light waves  continuous waves in a box can be thought of as infinitely many springlike motions one for each possible standing wave  each standing wave has a specific heat of kb so the total specific heat of a continuous wave like light should be infinite in classical mechanics  this is obviously wrong because it would mean that all energy in the universe would be instantly sucked up into light waves and everything would slow down and stop these inconsistencies led some people to say that atoms were not physical but mathematical  notable among the skeptics was ernst mach whose positivist philosophy led him to demand that if atoms are real it should be possible to see them directly  mach believed that atoms were a useful fiction that in reality they could be assumed to be infinitesimally small that avogadros number was infinite or so large that it might as well be infinite and kb was infinitesimally small  certain experiments could then be explained by atomic theory but other experiments could not and this is the way it will always be einstein opposed this position  throughout his career he was a realist he believed that a single consistent theory should explain all observations and that this theory would be a description of what was really going on underneath it all  so he set out to show that the atomic point of view was correct  this led him first to thermodynamics then to statistical physics and to the theory of specific heats of solids in 1905 while he was working in the patent office the leading german language physics journal annalen der physik published four of einsteins papers the four papers eventually were recognized as revolutionary and 1905 became known as einsteins miracle year and the papers as the annus mirabilis papers einsteins earliest papers were concerned with thermodynamics he wrote a paper establishing a thermodynamic identity in 1902 and a few other papers which attempted to interpret phenomena from a statistical atomic point of view his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena  as in maxwells work the finite nonzero size of atoms leads to effects which can be observed  this research and the thermodynamic identity were well within the mainstream of physics in his time they would eventually form the content of his phd thesis his first major result in this field was the theory of thermodynamic fluctuations  when in equilibrium a system has a maximum entropy and according to the statistical interpretation it can fluctuate a little bit  einstein pointed out that the statistical fluctuations of a macroscopic object like a mirror suspended on spring would be completely determined by the second derivative of the entropy with respect to the position of the mirror searching for ways to test this relation his great breakthrough came in 1905  the theory of fluctuations he realized would have a visible effect for an object which could move around freely  such an object would have a velocity which is random and would move around randomly just like an individual atom the average kinetic energy of the object would be kbt and the time decay of the fluctuations would be entirely determined by the law of friction the law of friction for a small ball in a viscous fluid like water was discovered by george stokes he showed that for small velocities the friction force would be proportional to the velocity and to the radius of the particle see stokes law  this relation could be used to calculate how far a small ball in water would travel due to its random thermal motion and einstein noted that such a ball of size about a micrometre would travel about a few micrometres per second  this motion could be easily detected with a microscope and indeed as brownian motion had actually been observed by the botanist robert brown einstein was able to identify this motion with that predicted by his theory  since the fluctuations which give rise to brownian motion are just the same as the fluctuations of the velocities of atoms measuring the precise amount of brownian motion using einsteins theory would show that boltzmanns constant is nonzero and would measure avogadros number these experiments were carried out a few years later by jean baptiste perrin and gave a rough estimate of avogadros number consistent with the more accurate estimates due to max plancks theory of blackbody light and robert millikans measurement of the charge of the electron  unlike the other methods einsteins required very few theoretical assumptions or new physics since it was directly measuring atomic motion on visible grains einsteins theory of brownian motion was the first paper in the field of statistical physics it established that thermodynamic fluctuations were related to dissipation  this was shown by einstein to be true for timeindependent fluctuations but in the brownian motion paper he showed that dynamical relaxation rates calculated from classical mechanics could be used as statistical relaxation rates to derive dynamical diffusion laws  these relations are known as einstein relations the theory of brownian motion was the least revolutionary of einsteins annus mirabilis papers but it is the most frequently cited and had an important role in securing the acceptance of the atomic theory by physicists einsteins thinking underwent a transformation in 1905  he had come to understand that quantum properties of light mean that maxwells equations were only an approximation he knew that new laws would have to replace these but he did not know how to go about finding those laws he felt that guessing formal relations would not go anywhere so he decided to focus on apriori principles instead which are statements about physical laws which can be understood to hold in a very broad sense even in domains where they have not yet been shown to apply a well accepted example of an apriori principle is rotational invariance if a new force is discovered in physics it is assumed to be rotationally invariant almost automatically without thought  einstein sought new principles of this sort to guide the production of physical ideas  once enough principles are found then the new physics will be the simplest theory consistent with the principles and with previously known laws the first general apriori principle he found was the principle of relativity that uniform motion is indistinguishable from rest  this was understood by hermann minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to spacetime  other principles postulated by einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number  another of einsteins general principles machs principle is fiercely debated and whether it holds in our world or not is still not definitively established the use of apriori principles is a distinctive unique signature of einsteins early work and has become a standard tool in modern theoretical physics his 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies introduced his theory of special relativity which showed that the observed independence of the speed of light on the observers state of motion required fundamental changes to the notion of simultaneity  consequences of this include the timespace frame of a moving body slowing down and contracting in the direction of motion relative to the frame of the observer  this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time was superfluous in his paper on massenergy equivalence which had previously been considered to be distinct concepts einstein deduced from his equations of special relativity what has been called the 20th centurys bestknown equation  emc2  this equation suggests that tiny amounts of mass could be converted into huge amounts of energy and presaged the development of nuclear power einsteins 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with max planck in a 1905 paper einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta  einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including max planck and niels bohr this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 with robert millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of compton scattering einsteins paper on the light particles was almost entirely motivated by thermodynamic considerations he was not at all motivated by the detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect which did not confirm his theory until fifteen years later einstein considers the entropy of light at temperature t and decomposes it into a lowfrequency part and a highfrequency part the highfrequency part where the light is described by wiens law has an entropy which looks exactly the same as the entropy of a gas of classical particles since the entropy is the logarithm of the number of possible states einstein concludes that the number of states of short wavelength light waves in a box with volume v is equal to the number of states of a group of localizable particles in the same box  since unlike others he was comfortable with the statistical interpretation he confidently postulates that the light itself is made up of localized particles as this is the only reasonable interpretation of the entropy this leads him to conclude that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each where h is plancks constant he does not say much more because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect einstein continued his work on quantum mechanics in 1906 by explaining the specific heat anomaly in solids  this was the first application of quantum theory to a mechanical system since plancks distribution for light oscillators had no problem with infinite specific heats the same idea could be applied to solids to fix the specific heat problem there  einstein showed in a simple model that the hypothesis that solid motion is quantized explains why the specific heat of a solid goes to zero at zero temperature einsteins model treats each atom as connected to a single spring  instead of connecting all the atoms to each other which leads to standing waves with all sorts of different frequencies einstein imagined that each atom was attached to a fixed point in space by a spring  this is not physically correct but it still predicts that the specific heat is 3nkb since the number of independent oscillations stays the same einstein then assumes that the motion in this model is quantized according to the planck law so that each independent spring motion has energy which is an integer multiple of hf where f is the frequency of oscillation  with this assumption he applied boltzmanns statistical method to calculate the average energy of the spring the result was the same as the one that planck had derived for light for temperatures where kbt is much smaller than hf the motion is frozen and the specific heat goes to zero so einstein concluded that quantum mechanics would solve the main problem of classical physics the specific heat anomaly the particles of sound implied by this formulation are now called phonons  because all of einsteins springs have the same stiffness they all freeze out at the same temperature and this leads to a prediction that the specific heat should go to zero exponentially fast when the temperature is low the solution to this problem is to solve for the independent normal modes individually and to quantize those  then each normal mode has a different frequency and long wavelength vibration modes freeze out at colder temperatures than short wavelength ones  this was done by peter debye and after this modification einsteins quantization method reproduced quantitatively the behavior of the specific heats of solids at low temperatures this work was the foundation of condensed matter physics throughout the 1910s quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems  after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms and the periodic table of the elements einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments wilhelm wien had made  wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process  einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant  arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics the law that the action variable is quantized was a basic principle of the quantum theory as it was known between 1900 and 1925 although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 he had not given up on academia  in 1908 he became a privatdozent at the university of bern in ber die entwicklung unserer anschauungen ber das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier 1909 paper einstein showed that max plancks energy quanta must have welldefined momenta and act in some respects as independent pointlike particles  this paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert n lewis in 1926 and inspired the notion of waveparticle duality in quantum mechanics einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point  ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density  at the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white  einstein relates this to raleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue einsteins physical intuition led him to note that plancks oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point he modified plancks hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to hf to half the energy spacing between levels  this argument which was made in 1913 in collaboration with otto stern was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms in 1907 while still working at the patent office einstein had what he would call his happiest thought he realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields he thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field he used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom he concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation although this approximation is crude it allowed him to calculate the deflection of light by gravity and show that it is nonzero  this gave him confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by gunnar nordstrm was incorrect but the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two because the approximation he used doesnt work well for things moving at near the speed of light  when einstein finished the full theory of general relativity he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun from prague einstein published a paper about the effects of gravity on light specifically the gravitational redshift and the gravitational deflection of light the paper challenged astronomers to detect the deflection during a solar eclipse  german astronomer erwin finlayfreundlich publicized einsteins challenge to scientists around the world einstein thought about the nature of the gravitational field in the years 19091912 studying its properties by means of simple thought experiments a notable one is the rotating disk  einstein imagined an observer making experiments on a rotating turntable he noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant pi than the one predicted by euclidean geometry the reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler but according to special relativity the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted since einstein believed that the laws of physics were local described by local fields he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved  this led him to study riemannian geometry and to formulate general relativity in this language while developing general relativity einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only in june 1913 the entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations  as its name suggests it was a sketch of a theory with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions  simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity after more than two years of intensive work einstein abandoned the theory in november 1915 after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken in 1912 einstein returned to switzerland to accept a professorship at his alma mater the eth once back in zurich he immediately visited his old eth classmate marcel grossmann now a professor of mathematics who introduced him to riemannian geometry and more generally to differential geometry  on the recommendation of italian mathematician tullio levicivita einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance essentially the use of tensors for his gravitational theory  for a while einstein thought that there were problems with the approach but he later returned to it and by late 1915 had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today  this theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter affecting the inertial motion of other matter during world war i the work of central powers scientists was available only to central powers academics for national security reasons some of einsteins work did reach the united kingdom and the united states through the efforts of the austrian paul ehrenfest and physicists in the netherlands especially 1902 nobel prizewinner hendrik lorentz and willem de sitter of leiden university after the war ended einstein maintained his relationship with leiden university accepting a contract as an extraordinary professor for ten years from 1920 to 1930 he travelled to holland regularly to lecture in 1917 several astronomers accepted einstein s 1911 challenge from prague the mount wilson observatory in california us published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift  in 1918 the lick observatory also in california announced that it too had disproved einsteins prediction although its findings were not published however in may 1919 a team led by the british astronomer arthur stanley eddington claimed to have confirmed einsteins prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the sun while photographing a solar eclipse with dual expeditions in sobral northern brazil and prncipe a west african island the international media guaranteed einsteins global renown there have been claims that scrutiny of the specific photographs taken on the eddington expedition showed the experimental uncertainty to be comparable to the same magnitude as the effect eddington claimed to have demonstrated and that a 1962 british expedition concluded that the method was inherently unreliable some resented the newcomers fame notably among some german physicists who later started the deutsche physik german physics movement in 1917 einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole he wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity  to fix this einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion the cosmological constant  with a positive cosmological constant the universe could be an eternal static sphere einstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred because it would obey machs principle he had shown that general relativity incorporates machs principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields but he knew that machs idea would not work if space goes on forever  in a closed universe he believed that machs principle would hold machs principle has generated much controversy over the years in 1917 at the height of his work on relativity einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode  this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws einstein discovered louis de broglies work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first  in another major paper from this era einstein gave a wave equation for de broglie waves which einstein suggested was the hamiltonjacobi equation of mechanics  this paper would inspire schrdingers work of 1926 in 1924 einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles  einstein noted that boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of boses paper to the zeitschrift fr physik einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the boseeinstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultracooling equipment built at the nistjila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder boseeinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons  einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum  noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noethers presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates he maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field  this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz and others and has become standard the use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin schrdinger and others following his research on general relativity einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation which would allow the explanation of electromagnetism  in 1950 he described his unified field theory in a scientific american article entitled on the generalized theory of gravitation although he continued to be lauded for his work einstein became increasingly isolated in his research and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces which were not well understood until many years after his death  mainstream physics in turn largely ignored einsteins approaches to unification  einsteins dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantummechanical setting einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a wormhole  his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches if one end of a wormhole was positively charged the other end would be negatively charged  these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion  this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the 1920s the theory of general relativity has a fundamental law  the einstein equations which describe how space curves the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the einstein equations since the equations of general relativity are nonlinear a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like a black hole would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein equations themselves not by a new law  so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution like a black hole would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself this was established by einstein infeld and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum and by roy kerr for spinning objects in addition to his wellaccepted results some of einsteins views are regarded as controversial in addition to long time collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann and others einstein also had some oneshot collaborations with various scientists einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons nowadays known to be the spin  in order to show this they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate because the electrons angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes  this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization einstein suggested to erwin schrdinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a boseeinstein gas by considering a box  then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator  quantizing these oscillators each level will have an integer occupation number which will be the number of particles in it this formulation is a form of second quantization but it predates modern quantum mechanics  erwin schrdinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas  schrdinger urged einstein to add his name as coauthor although einstein declined the invitation in 1926 einstein and his former student le szilrd coinvented and in 1930 patented the einstein refrigerator  this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input  on 11 november 1930  was awarded to albert einstein and le szilrd for the refrigerator  their invention was not immediately put into commercial production as the most promising of their patents were quickly bought up by the swedish company electrolux to protect its refrigeration technology from competition einstein was never satisfied by what he perceived to be quantum theorys intrinsically incomplete description of nature and in 1935 he further explored the issue in collaboration with boris podolsky and nathan rosen noting that the theory seems to require nonlocal interactions this is known as the epr paradox the epr experiment has since been performed with results confirming quantum theorys predictions  repercussions of the einsteinbohr debate have found their way into philosophical discourse in 1935 einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics he considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other he noted along with his collaborators that by performing different measurements on the distant particle either of position or momentum different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way he then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined the principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be without in any way disturbing the particle then the particle actually has values of position or momentum this principle distilled the essence of einsteins objection to quantum mechanics  as a physical principle it has since been shown to be incompatible with experiments einstein flouted the ascendant nazi movement and later tried to be a voice of moderation in the tumultuous formation of the state of israel fred jerome in his einstein on israel and zionism his provocative ideas about the middle east argues that einstein was a cultural zionist who supported the idea of a jewish homeland but opposed the establishment of a jewish state in palestine with borders an army and a measure of temporal power  instead he preferred a binational state with continuously functioning mixed administrative economic and social organizations  however ami isseroff in his article was einstein a zionist argues that einstein supported the recognition of the state of israel and declared it the fulfillment of our dream when president harry truman recognized israel in may 1948  in the presidential election of 1948 einstein supported henry a wallaces progressive party which advocated prosoviet and proisrael foreign policy throughout the november revolution in germany einstein signed an appeal for the foundation of a nationwide liberal and democratic party in his article why socialism published in 1949 in the monthly review einstein described a chaotic capitalist society a source of evil to be overcome as the predatory phase of human development he came to the following conclusion he braved anticommunist politics and resistance to the civil rights movement in the united states on the floor of the us congress einstein was accused by john e rankin of mississippi of being a foreignborn agitator who sought to further the spread of communism throughout the world he also participated in the 1927 congress of the league against imperialism in brussels after world war ii as enmity between the former allies became a serious issue einstein wrote i do not know how the third world war will be fought but i can tell you what they will use in the fourth rocks   with albert schweitzer and bertrand russell einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs  days before his death einstein signed the russelleinstein manifesto which led to the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs einstein was a member of several civil rights groups including the princeton chapter of the naacp when the aged w e b du bois was accused of being a communist spy einstein volunteered as a character witness and the case was dismissed shortly afterward  einsteins friendship with activist paul robeson with whom he served as cochair of the american crusade to end lynching lasted twenty years einstein said politics is for the moment equation for the eternity he declined the presidency of israel in 1952 the question of scientific determinism gave rise to questions about einsteins position on theological determinism and whether or not he believed in god or in a god he once said while travelling einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death she died in 1986  barbara wolff of the hebrew universitys albert einstein archives told the bbc that there are about 3500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 einstein bequeathed the royalties from use of his image to the hebrew university of jerusalem corbis successor to the roger richman agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery as agent for the university in the period before world war ii einstein was so wellknown in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory he finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries he told his inquirers pardon me sorry  always i am mistaken for professor einstein einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels films plays and works of music he is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absentminded professors his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated  time magazines frederic golden wrote that einstein was a cartoonists dream come true in 1922 einstein was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect  this refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time the presentation speech began by mentioning his theory of relativity 91which had93 been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles 91and93 also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time  it was long reported that einstein gave the nobel prize money to his first wife mileva mari in compliance with their 1919 divorce settlement  however personal correspondence made public in 2006 shows that he invested much of it in the united states and saw much of it wiped out in the great depression in 1929 max planck presented einstein with the max planck medal of the german physical society in berlin for extraordinary achievements in theoretical physics in 1936 einstein was awarded the franklin institutes franklin medal for his extensive work on relativity and the photoelectric effect the international union of pure and applied physics named 2005 the world year of physics in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of the annus mirabilis papers the albert einstein science park is located on the hill telegrafenberg in potsdam germany the best known building in the park is the einstein tower which has a bronze bust of einstein at the entrance the tower is an astrophysical observatory that was built to perform checks of einsteins theory of general relativity the albert einstein memorial in central washington dc is a monumental bronze statue depicting einstein seated with manuscript papers in hand the statue commissioned in 1979 is located in a grove of trees at the southwest corner of the grounds of the national academy of sciences on constitution avenue the chemical element 99 einsteinium was named for him in august 1955 four months after einsteins death 2001 einstein is an inner main belt asteroid discovered on 5 march 1973 in 1999 time magazine named him the person of the century ahead of mahatma gandhi and franklin roosevelt among others  in the words of a biographer to the scientifically literate and the public at large einstein is synonymous with genius  also in 1999 an opinion poll of 100 leading physicists ranked einstein the greatest physicist ever a gallup poll recorded him as the fourth most admired person of the 20th century in the us in 1990 his name was added to the walhalla temple for laudable and distinguished germans which is located east of regensburg in bavaria germany the united states postal service honored einstein with a prominent americans series 19651978 8 postage stamp the albert einstein award sometimes called the albert einstein medal because it is accompanied with a gold medal is an award in theoretical physics established to recognize high achievement in the natural sciences it was endowed by the lewis and rosa strauss memorial fund in honor of albert einsteins 70th birthday it was first awarded in 1951 and included a prize money of 15000 the winner is selected by a committee the first of which consisted of einstein oppenheimer von neumann and weyl of the institute for advanced study which administers the award the albert einstein medal is an award presented by the albert einstein society in bern switzerland first given in 1979 the award is presented to people who have rendered outstanding services in connection with einstein the albert einstein peace prize is given yearly by the chicago illinoisbased albert einstein peace prize foundation winners of the prize receive 50000 ,class1
austriangerman as german is a pluricentric language austrian german is merely one among several varieties of standard german much like the relationship between american and british english the austrian and german varieties differ in minor issues eg spelling word usage and grammar but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible the official austrian dictionary das sterreichische wrterbuch gives grammar and spelling rules defining the official language  in addition to this standard variety in everyday life most austrians speak one of a number of high german dialects with german being a pluricentric language austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of standard german spoken by most austrians which is distinct from that of germany or switzerland distinctions in vocabulary persist for example in culinary terms where communication with germans is frequently difficult and administrative and legal language which is due to austrias exclusion from the development of a german nationstate in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions a comprehensive collection of austriangerman legal administrative and economic terms is offered in  markhardt heidemarie wrterbuch der sterreichischen rechts wirtschafts und verwaltungsterminologie peter lang 2006 the former standard used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language was the schnbrunner deutsch a sociolect spoken by the imperial habsburg family and the nobility of austriahungary it differs from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation it appears to be spoken through the nose a little and could be compared to the queens english this was not a standard in a modern sense  it was the standard upper class way of speaking here are some examples for many years austria had a special form of the language for official government documents   this form is known as sterreichische kanzleisprache a term that is difficult to translate into english but could be translated as austrian chancellery language it is a very traditional form of the language probably derived from middle ages deeds documents and has a very complicated structure and vocabulary which is generally reserved only for such documents   for most speakers even native speakers this form of the language is generally difficult to understand as it contains many special terms some of which are specific in terms of use as there are diplomatic intern official military etc  there are no regional variations because this special form of written document mainly was used by government that for centuries now is based in vienna currently sterreichische kanzleisprache is being used less and less mostly because of various reforms in government and administration which in turn led to the fewer classic civil servants the beamter as a result standard german is replacing it in government and administrative texts when austria became a member of the european union the austrian variety of the german language  limited to 23 agricultural terms  was protected in the socalled protocol no 10 in austria as in the germanspeaking parts of switzerland and in southern germany verbs that express a state tend to use sein as the auxiliary verb in the perfect as well as verbs of movement  verbs which fall into this category include sitzen to sit liegen to lie and in parts of carinthia schlafen to sleep  therefore the perfect of these verbs would be ich bin gesessen ich bin gelegen and ich bin geschlafen respectively note ich bin geschlafen is a very rare form usually you will hear ich habe geschlafen but ich bin eingeschlafen i fell asleep is quite normal in the variant of german that is spoken in germany the words stehen to stand and gestehen to confess are identical in the present perfect habe gestanden the austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity bin gestanden  from stehen habe gestanden from gestehen also the preterite simple past is very rarely used in austria especially in the spoken language except for some modal verbs ich sollte ich wollte there are many official terms that differ in austrian german from their usage in most parts of germany these include jnner january rather than januar feber february rather than februar  heuer this year rather than dieses jahr kasten wardrobe instead of schrank kiste crate instead of schachtel sessel chair instead of stuhl stiege stairs instead of treppe rauchfang chimney instead of schornstein vorzimmer hallway instead of diele many administrative legal and political terms  and a whole series of foods and vegetables such as  erdpfel potatoes german kartoffeln but dutch aardappel schlagobers whipped cream german schlagsahne faschiertes ground beef german hackfleisch fisolen green beans german gartenbohne karfiol cauliflower german blumenkohl karotte carrot german mhre kohlsprossen brussels sprouts german rosenkohl marillen apricots german aprikosen paradeiser tomatoes german tomaten palatschinken pancakes german pfannkuchen topfen a semisweet cottage cheese german quark and kren horseradish german meerrettich austrians in particular will say gr gott literally greet god meaning may god bless you when greeting someone rather than the guten tag have a good day used by many germans bavarians excluded  beside the official austrian german austrian dialects from various regions are occasionally seen in written form containing a large number of contractions and abbreviations compared to standard german which can be hard to understand for nonnative speakers although the same applies to german dialects in germany and switzerland one thing which also deserves attention is one of the ways austrians say goodbye  baba which is relatively informal the german dictionary publisher langenscheidt has released an austrianenglish dictionary with 1440 pages it offers 130000 terms 2000 of which are austriacisms while strong forms of the various dialects are not normally fully comprehensible to northern germans there is virtually no communication barrier to speakers from bavaria the central austrobavarian dialects are more intelligible to speakers of standard german than the southern austrobavarian dialects of tyrol viennese the austrobavarian dialect of vienna is most frequently used in germany for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of austria the people of graz the capital of styria speak yet another dialect which is not very styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of austria than other styrian dialects for example from western styria simple words in the various dialects are very similar but pronunciation is distinct for each and after listening to a few spoken words it may be possible for an austrian to realise which dialect is being spoken  however in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the tirol other tyroleans are often unable to understand them  speakers from the different states of austria can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents probably more so than bavarians those of carinthia styria vienna upper austria and the tirol being very characteristic  speakers from those regions even those speaking standard german can usually be easily identified by their accent even by an untrained listener several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with nongermanic linguistic groups such as the dialect of carinthia where in the past many speakers were bilingual with slovene and the dialect of vienna which has been influenced by immigration during the austrohungarian period particularly from what is today the czech republic the german dialects of bolzanobozen alto adigesouth tyrol have been influenced by local romance languages in particular with many loan words from italian and ladin interestingly the geographic borderlines between the different accents isoglosses coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with bavaria with bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language,class2
