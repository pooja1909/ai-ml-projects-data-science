cocoa,The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market government delegates and trade experts said Only two weeks ago world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated This week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ITC which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations The ITCs failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with builtin flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought One consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the must buy level of 1600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100000 tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade It has an upper limit of 250000 tonnes The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over nonmember cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on Thursday Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in nonmember countries such as Malaysia Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premiumpriced high quality cocoas The argument over buying nonmember cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent nonmember cocoa and that it use the London futures markets existing differentials for different qualities Currently good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market Discounts which are currently under review range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community a key ICCO consumer group with France siding with producers EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there One ICCO delegate describing the producerconsumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not In contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers Other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers In either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers REUTER 3
cocoa,Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organizations buffer stock manager industry sources told Reuters The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it one company spokesman said Including the 3000 tonnes he acquired on Friday the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21000 tonnes Despite this buying the price of cocoa is well under the 1600 Special Drawing Rights SDRs a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market Even before he started operations traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1600 SDR level and yet he appears reluctant to do so one manufacturer said We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75000 tonnes in a fairly short period and then simply step back he added The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next one processor said As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods he added Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come Reuter 3

cocoa,The International Cocoa Organization ICCO moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday a consumer delegate said The atmosphere is excellent Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1 if the rules are agreed by Friday A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon a big step toward a very interesting stage of negotiations delegates said The package based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates has been forged bit by bit during fortnightlong meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates Producers the European Community EC and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow Under the proposal the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the secondhand market on an offer system He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired delegates said The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before giving preference to ICCO membercountry exporters Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin similar to golf handicaps to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins they said The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager the delegates said Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council Buffer stock purchases from nonICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock they said The purchases would be limited to 5000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20000 tonnes per week and could be bought in nearby intermediate and forward positions they added One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is transparency meaning virtually all the buffer stock managers market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible delegates said After the tin market collapse in 1985 when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism they said Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn delegates said The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force The existing buffer stock of 100000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs both untouchable until rules are agreed Though the current semiannual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules producers are keen to get the wheels of the marketstabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices delegates said Reuter 3

cocoa,Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows So far only 21000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this traders noted only on an intermittent basis They noted the purchases of 8000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13000 in the second are well short of the limitations of no more than 5000 tonnes in one day and 20000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10day average indicator to its 1935 sdr per tonne midway point or reference price However little progress has been made in that direction and the 10day average is still well below the 1600 sdr lower intervention level at 156287 from 156946 previously The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic traders said Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers they observed A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities In London traders expressed surprise that no more than 21000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150000 tonnes Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100000 tonnes Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Fridays close basis July at its high of 1271 It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market prices go up while when he declares his intention to buy quite often the reverse applies traders said Reuter 3

cocoa,New York cocoa traders reacted with caution to todays developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London saying there is still time for negotiations to break down I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point said Jack Ward president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat If and when a final position comes out of the ICCO talks one will still have time to put on positions The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details Market sentiment has reflected optimism I wouldt put it any stronger than that Ward said It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement but one shouldnt forget how much they have to negotiate said another trader of todays developments Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so traders said The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms one trader said Speculators have gone net long but only slightly so he added The recent price strength gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days has been due in large part to sterlings rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling traders said Reuter 3

cocoa,Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance CPA said The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11member CPA which began on Monday They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon Prices under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a preset range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer Another source said that with much of the 198687 OctoberSeptember world cocoa crop sold limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest The sources noted however that the cocoa industry in Brazil the worlds number two producer is in private hands This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards The CPA includes the worlds top three producers Ivory Coast Brazil and Ghana and accounts for 80 pct of all output The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening Reuter 3

cocoa,The International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks cocoa traders said Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 157803 Special Drawing Rights SDR per tonne below the 1600 must buy level Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations traders said Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or endApril when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1600 SDR must buy level The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets The daily price was 157761 SDR per tonne yesterday Months used currently for the indicator are May July and September but these are set to change to July September and December on April 15 prior to May becoming the New York spot month traders noted The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10day average the indicator which governs his activities traders said The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts If purchases reach this level within six months buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 15 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 198687 world surplus to between 50000 and 70000 tonnes compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94000 tonnes traders said In these circumstances the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20000 and 30000 tonnes to lift prices above the must buy level But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from nonmembers could limit the buffer stocks scope for action dealers said Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby instore material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and nonmember cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material traders said Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures Ghanas premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying dealers said The buffer stock may not help the terminal market but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas one trader said Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were all prognostication and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism REUTER 3

cocoa,The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ICCO is an improvement on previous arrangements but the pricesupport mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices many ICCO delegates and trade sources said The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35member ICCO council after two weeks of talks European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long If the buffer stock operation is successful I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices a European dealer said And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically dealers said The buffer stock is the marketregulating tool of the ICCO into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a preset stabilization range A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time The new rules take effect immediately The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market since prices are below the mustbuy level of 1600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement the sources said The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100000 tonnes within a five week period but its approach will be more cautious buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250000 tonnes of cocoa 100000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices Ivory Coast is the worlds largest cocoa producer We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee However some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact Ghana whose highquality cocoa is the worlds most expensive and provides 60 pct of the countrys export earnings made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany Consumers werent perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules We reached a very sensitive compromiseThere were no real winners or losers Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks and as a result doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have delegates said Under the new rules the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas using price differentials to reflect different qualities NonICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock London cocoa prices traded today around 1300 stg per tonne down from around 1450 stg in January 1987 and 1750 stg in January 1986 A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it according to the agreement The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled or if the buffer stock runs low on funds it says The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 912 ICCO officials said REUTER 3

cocoa,Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao although normal humidity levels have not been restored Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review The dry period means the temporao will be late this year Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 593 mln against 581 at the same stage last year Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end With total Bahia crop estimates around 64 mln bags and sales standing at almost 62 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers middlemen exporters and processors There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1750 to 1780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with JuneJuly going at 1850 and 1880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july AugSept at 1870 1875 and 1880 dlrs per tonne FOB Routine sales of butter were made MarchApril sold at 4340 4345 and 4350 dlrs AprilMay butter went at 227 times New York May JuneJuly at 4400 and 4415 dlrs AugSept at 4351 to 4450 dlrs and at 227 and 228 times New York Sept and OctDec at 4480 dlrs and 227 times New York Dec Comissaria Smith said Destinations were the US Covertible currency areas Uruguay and open ports Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for MarchApril 785 dlrs for May 753 dlrs for Aug and 039 times New York Dec for OctDec Buyers were the US Argentina Uruguay and convertible currency areas Liquor sales were limited with MarchApril selling at 2325 and 2380 dlrs JuneJuly at 2375 dlrs and at 125 times New York July AugSept at 2400 dlrs and at 125 times New York Sept and OctDec at 125 times New York Dec Comissaria Smith said Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 613 mln bags against the 198687 crop and 106 mln bags against the 198788 crop Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27 Reuter 3

cocoa,The International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon delegates said The plan presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn represented a compromise between producer European Community EC and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate they said The proposal involved three key principles First the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously delegates said Under an offer system the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices they said The second provision was that nonICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa to be set by a formula the delegates said After the plan was presented working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT producer delegates said Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from one consumer delegate said Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change Reuter 3

cocoa,Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization ICCO council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules delegates said While consumers do not yet have a common position an observer said after a consumer meeting They are much more fluid and the tone is positive European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect delegates said At the January meeting France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate delegates said That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this months meeting The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues delegates said The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether nonmember cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa delegates said A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the nonmember cocoa question A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting followed by a consumer meeting Producers who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose nonmember cocoa being accepted reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon We are waiting to see what consumers say a producer delegate said We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate The ICCO comprises 33 member countries Non members include the US a consumer and Malaysia an increasingly important producer Reuter 3

cocoa,Lack of rainfall in recent weeks may have affected Ivory Coast 198788 main crop cocoa prospects although good precipitation in the last half of June and in July could still reverse the situation trade sources said They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large and it is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spell on the harvest This years crop will probably be another good one It is impossible to tell how flowering is going but there should be no problems unless something drastic happens one trader said Private forecaster AccuWeather reported today that most Ivory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the weekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday Rain would be welcomed as the past week has been quite dry except along the western portion of the coast it said Traders agreed rain was needed but some noted that the dry conditions had not affected the entire country The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached for comment or recent statistics The trade sources said rainfall in recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants although it is difficult to assess what the minimum requirements are Trade sources said there had been good rains in late January February and March which helped to promote flowering but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in the south west of the country The Ivory Coast midcrop should have been covered by MarchApril rains but the main crop still in its formation period depends largely on rainfall from April through July The main rains normally last between May and July before returning again in SeptemberOctober Flowering has been less than normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the moment then they have a chance to recover one trader said Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of time to develop and the rains were not good but still not bad The sources said that while the weather might emerge as a cause for concern crop conditions in West Africa were presently taking a back seat to other factors in the international cocoa market This is not only because of the premature nature of any harvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa already burdening the market they said With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and the buffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases the weather has not been a factor one private consultant said Londonbased dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoa market report the current 198687 Ivory Coast crop was likely to total 570000 tonnes which compares with a record 198586 crop estimate of 585000 tonnes Reuter 3
cocoa,Government officials in Malaysia a major cocoa producer have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement ICCA for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysias participation but so far a decision has not been announced The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage Malaysia is the worlds fourth largest cocoa producer The government feels that the pact through its buffer stock mechanism can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses officials said But growers and traders are concerned Malaysias participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to nonmember countries of the ICCA They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysias cocoa exports officially estimated at 112000 tonnes in 1986 goes to nonmembers Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump Malaysia which produced 117000 tonnes of cocoa last year might be forced to withhold up to 70000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the longterm and this might affect their economic viability they said The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs an industry source said The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from nonmembers for the stockpile Under the new rules purchases from nonmembers such as Malaysia will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon officials said but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date REUTER 3
cocoa,Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 20 mln to 25 mln bag range against 25 mln to 30 mln a fortnight ago Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since midFebruary which broke a six week drought plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the MaySeptember crop The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 10 mln to 15 mln bags might be expected Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered However the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid and which is more likely from late July on This years crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500000 bags in a very short period one source said Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 20 mln bag mark if the disease hits Although flowering was good following the start of the rains pod setting was not up to expectations possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers the sources said However reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good which should result in mature fruit from August through September The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop which officially starts on October 1 The cutoff date is completely artificial If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December one said If predictions of a 20 to 25 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 27 mln bag average for the past 10 years The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 179 mln bags the lowest since 1974 Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 312 mln bags just below the 1983 317 mln bag record while last years output which also suffered some drought damage was 277 mln bags Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this years record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30 Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared Because of the high turnover of beans this year significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals With official arrivals figures for the 198687 temporao and main crops totalling over 61 mln bags and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year the total outturn should be at least a record 65 mln bags if all production is declared the sources said This would compare with the previous record set last year of 603 mln However there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 198687 harvest may never be officially registered Reuter 3

gold,A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities Over the past three weeks Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year And Credit Suisse and Credit SuisseFirst Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character though they are aimed at a less professional market The market is still small Taken together the four Americanled warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank Switzerland AG said The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a longterm investment in gold with limited risk Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27 following it up with a second issue less than a week later The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA The idea found some quick copies Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and coled an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty Switzerland AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce the same price as the underlying commodity to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months in all cases longer than gold futures and options on US Markets The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of US Consumer prices for January when a jump of 07 pct raised again the threat of inflation Many people are worried about inflation again said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold The gold market having seen strong gains in 1986 has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland People here understand gold and they understand warrants he said Citicorp Switzerland pioneered warrants with a series of equitylinked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years and last autumn Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens and to play it with higher leverage But after a quick flurry of issues that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his banks issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium The issue for five ounces at 425 dlrs was priced at 955 Swiss francs making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct Using a Black Sholes options model he said the issues long 43year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 245 pct for the option to pay off which he claimed was lower than the other issues But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science And each bank using its own model put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct Whatever the calculation the issues have received a warm welcome from investors Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand even among small investors who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece The most sophisticated ones wouldnt buy these because the premiums are too high he said REUTER 3

gnp,Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presenting his budget for fiscal 198788 to Parliament said UK Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 25 billion stg after a 11 billion shortfall in 1986 Inflation is expected to be 40 pct at the end of this year Lawson said As I forecast in the Autumn Statement inflation may continue to edge up for a time perhaps exceeding 45 pct by the summer before falling back to 40 pct by the end of the year he added Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 198687 was 40 billion stg or 10 pct of GDP The planned PSBR for 198788 was set at 40 billion stg On monetary policy Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 198788 No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate he said But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as of course will the exchange rate the Chancellor told Parliament Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 198687 is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of nonoil tax revenues in general and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987 He said it is clear that the increased flow of nonoil tax revenues coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure puts the public finances in a very strong position Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 10 pct of GDP in future We have reached what I judge to be the Medium Term Financial Strategys appropriate destination a PSBR of 10 pct of GDP My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead Lawson said Inevitably this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation which of course remains a major objective of government policy But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution and to build a still firmer base for the future Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book On corporation tax he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 198788 But companies capital gains will be charged at the appropriate corporation tax rate He said that under the new proposed system companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax ACT payments against tax on capital gains Taken together these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 198889 Lawson said Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax to be known as Pay and File This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection and would not come into force until the early 1990s Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT As from today companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their PRT liabilities in existing fields until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred Second there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into UK Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field On business employment Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers Lawson said that in future traders registered for Value Added Tax VAT would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days he added and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21300 stg New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance he added The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125000 stg Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment The change will take effect on April 1 1987 but genuine trading companies will not be affected He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans also from April 1 In future banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan he said The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence to 27 pct from 29 pct Lawson reiterated the governments aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound but added given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR that goal cannot be achieved in this budget Small companies corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct he said On the Lloyds insurance market Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyds syndicates bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyds about the details of the legislation he said The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyds account which closes on December 31 this year Lawson said MORE 3

gnp,Senior US Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers reiterated the Reagan Administrations opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth By contrast Rudolph Penner Director of the Congressional Budget Office said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987 Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments He also suggested a lineitem veto which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it to limit wasteful spending Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 27 pct growth in US Real gross national product GNP in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable Sprinkel said It looks pretty good to me Weve had two very strong employment reports He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate adding It looks like theyre on track While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives he said Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the longrun consequences of tax reform Sprinkel said In 1986 this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit In fiscal 1986 ending September federal spending amounted to 238 pct of GNP while federal receipts absorbed 185 pct of GNP leaving a deficit of 53 pct he said Sprinkel said that compared with fiscal 1978 the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 27 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same Contrary to the conventional wisdom therefore the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years Sprinkel said This tax cut merely rolled back the inflationinduced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981 he added However the Congressional Budget Offices Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress indeed with increases in defence spending now all the options for reducing the budget deficit are unpleasant he said Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the US Caused by the biggest sustained inflation in our nations history which helped foster widespread distrust of government The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level Penner said But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot Penner sees little hope the GrammRudmanHollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because theres no Way to enforce it Penner said Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by onetime measures such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988 That saved more than two billion dlrs Penner said REUTER 3

rubber,A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today The new accord is due to replace the current one which expires in October Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented a historic moment The latest round of talks which began March 9 represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years Xuto described the negotiations as by no means easy and we often faced problems The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now delegates said During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies Xuto added He also praised the spirit of give and take that prevailed throughout this session Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia speaking on behalf of producers said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is a vital consideration for multinational tire companies whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new Gerard Guillonneau of France speaking for consumers agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well But as economic conditions had changed he said consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning He added that the adoption of the new agreement attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry Reuter 3
rubber,Producers and consumers representing most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA aimed at stabilizing world prices over the next five years Negotiations for a new INRA to succeed the present one which runs out next October began nearly two years ago Agreement on the new fiveyear pact which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall was reached at a twoweek session here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD Reuter 3
rubber,The new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA like the 1979 pact will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention excluding export quotas or production controls The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one The reference price currently 20166 MalaysianSingapore cts per kilo will be maintained unless between now and October 22 when the 1979 INRA expires the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention may sell price 231 cts or below the lower intervention may buy price 171 cts for six months If this happened but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Similarly if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300000 tonnes have been made since the last revision the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15month intervals instead of 18 Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends As in the present accord the may buy and may sell levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price and the must buy and must sell levels at 20 pct of it The lower and upper indicative prices floor and ceiling prices will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months During the negotiations consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock currently 360000 tonnes rose to 450000 tonnes The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one 400000 tonnes with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150000 tonnes Under the new accord the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price At last Fridays session Ahmed Farouk speaking for producers said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created Gerard Guillonneau of France who spoke for consumers agreed that the current agreement had worked relatively well Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA delegates noted that for nearly its whole life the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the must buy level They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber In addition provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated ruling out speculation It is a sort of middleoftheroad agreement one delegate said The new pact will be open for signature at UN Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year To become operational it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now During the hiatus between the two agreements the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it REUTER 3

rubber,Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA but growers and traders are unhappy with the development according to views polled by Reuter correspondents Officials in Malaysia Indonesia and Thailand which produce the bulk of the worlds rubber said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the longterm But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises The new INRA to replace the current one which expires on October 22 was formally adopted by most of the worlds producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday It will be open for signature at the UN Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members he said Under the existing pact members can borrow from banks to finance INRAs buffer stock purchases This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse like the International Tin Agreement This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance Lim said Malaysia the worlds largest producer was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members he said Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesias rubber industrys by stabilising prices It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened they said Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations Malaysian growers however said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers With the INRAs ability to keep prices at a certain stable level consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price while producers may never see sharp price rises a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises he said State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRAs inception and the creation of a buffer stock and they seemed unlikely to rise Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock they added Traders in the region meanwhile said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pacts conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future The 360000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned a Malaysian trader said Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it but they questioned the ability of some financiallystrapped producers to finance buffer stock operations REUTER 3

tin,Consuming countries chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ITC price support operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving a Reuter survey showed They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by nonmembers undermining the pacts Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed The International Cocoa Organization ICCO last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager BSM could do under the new agreement It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of nonmember cocoa This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the worlds fourth largest producer undermining the market The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was adopted earlier this month in Geneva Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling Legal wrangles continue Recent International Coffee Organization ICO negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said Consumers and a small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil the worlds leading producer Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct The talks broke down and although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote International agreements exist for sugar and wheat These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber The UN Common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the US Nor the Soviet Union has ratified

balancing producer and consumer interests We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose longterm trend is downward official Administration policy states The US Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses the International Coffee Agreement ICA and INRA but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts The US Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the State Department said US Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working US Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement US Officials said Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they

of world tin The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50000 from 70000 Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsThe German approach is sceptical We dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of openended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said UK Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts France a large consumer and producer of sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks Indonesias Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclicalBut its another matter when there are structural problemsBut we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods REUTER 3

tin,The tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices a Malaysian government bulletin said The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80000 tonnes overhang It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin the bulletin said A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms it added Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo the bulletin said REUTER 3

graincorn,Zambias marketed maize production will probably fall to less than 630000 tonnes in 198687 MayApr from 918000 last year because of poor rainfall in major producing areas Agriculture Minister Kingsley Chinkuli said He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous marketing year The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags 630000 tonnes of maize this year he stated Chinkuli added that Zambia was setting up an irrigation fund with Canadian aid to lessen the effects of poor rainfall REUTER 3
graincorn,Recent purchases of US corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels cash grain dealers said Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior which a dealer in Davenport Iowa said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed If the USDA acts soon as many dealers expect the movement would break the Gulf corn basis The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices one dealer said It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest But we dont know when they might do it an Ohio dealer said which has created uncertainty in the market The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage Yesterday USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 385 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers in lieu of cash payments had to date been exchanged for grain With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices cash grain dealers said A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals cash dealers said Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price The mild winter and early reopening of the midMississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight dealers noted The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings they said The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 40 mln tonnes of US corn one Midwest cash grain trader said But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system Reuter 3

graincorn,The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 16 billion dlrs worth of inkind certificates or certs to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs USDA officials said Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop now complete were made in a 5050 cashcertificate split and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains Over 32 billion dlrs of an estimated 60 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced with 142 billion dlrs 43 pct set in certificates The final payment must be 16 billion dlrs in certs 57 pct for a 5050 split However the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to as soon as five months after harvest as possible rather than the current year lag time Neither Rep Edward Madigan RIll nor Sen Bob Dole RKans sponsors of the bills have brought the legislation forward Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions Reuter 3

graincorn,US Agriculture Department USDA figures for highlyerodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish although some said a full statebystate breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact Out of 105 mln acres only 19 mln acres were accepted in corn Thats neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said The USDA said it had accepted 10572402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11254837 acres Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31 Indications of a heavy signup in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 630 to 670 mln acres from 670 to 690 mln Richard Loewy analyst with Prudential Bache Securities said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures The 19 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing he added The USDA later released the statebystate breakdown of the enrollment figures Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring he said The trade was definitely looking higher so certificates are going to be less than expected The USDA offered a special corn bonus rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel based on the farm program payment yield for corn for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve Katharina Zimmer analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures said the conservation signup was slightly higher than she had expected although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures I think it is friendly for the market at least in the long run she said Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total signup or the latest addition It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program she said Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation signup She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60s Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large signup in the program despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures Reuter 3

graincorn,Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 198687 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April trade sources said They said sunflower maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm dry weather which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas However as showers fell intermittently after last weekend producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province 83 mm in Cordoba 41 in Santa Fe 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones 95 in Corrientes eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops including soybean However as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 21 mln to 23 mln tonnes against 22 mln to 24 mln forecast last week and down 439 to 488 pct on the 198586 record of 41 mln Area sown to sunflowers was two to 22 mln hectares 299 to 363 pct below the record 314 mln hectares last season Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 95 mln to 98 mln tonnes against 96 mln to 99 mln estimated previously This is 222 to 234 pct below the 124 mln to 126 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 198586 crop and 219 to 258 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes Maize was sown on 358 mln to 378 mln hectares two to seven pct down on last seasons 385 mln Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and Chaco Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in midApril The total area sown was 123 mln to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct down on the 145 mln sown last season The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 29 mln to 32 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 33 mln forecast last week and is 238 to 293 pct down on last seasons 41 mln to 42 mln tonne crop The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted remaining at a record 75 mln to 77 mln tonnes up 42 to 55 pct on the 72 mln to 73 mln estimated by private sources for 198586 and 56 to 85 pct higher than the official figure of 71 mln The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 mln to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct up on the record 334 mln sown in 198586 The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available Preparation of the fields for the 198788 wheat crop which will be sown between May and August or September has so far not been as intense as in previous years Reuter 3
graincorn,The US corn and soybean crops are in mostly good condition and have not suffered any yield deterioration from recent hot dry weather Agriculture Department and private weather and crop analysts said I dont see any reduction in yield potential yet Norton Strommen chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters The corn and soybean crop is actually in mostly good condition and is progressing ahead of normal which is good he said Abnormally hot dry weather in midwestern crop areas sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today causing new crop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 614 dlrs per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 281 dlrs This rally is amazing a private crop analyst said Corn soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up development of the crop which will help the crop better cope with stress later in its more critical growing period What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards rapid development of a good deep root system to draw on the subsoil reserve It actually strengthens the crop to go through a little stress early on Strommen said Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in most growing areas Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July and August But because of its early development this year Strommen said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction period by the first of July Weatherwise if the market is truly concerned about corn or soybeans it should be more concerned about corn But the dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks an analyst said Soybeans on the other hand can withstand several more weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating crop analysts agreed August and September are the critical yieldproducing months for soybeans Strommen said The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive during May June and July until the August rains which determine the crop a crop analyst said Some analysts contend however that in certain growing areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure that there will not be problems later Strommen noted the USDAs current six to 10 day weather forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in much of the corn belt This opens up all sorts of speculation he said Reuter 3

graincorn,Congress eager to find budget savings launches a review of the US Agriculture Departments generic commodity certificate program tomorrow amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office GAO are at odds over how much the program has cost US taxpayers The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that paymentinkind or PIK certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays administration officials who asked not to be identified said USDA officials however took issue with the report saying it did not take into account storage handling and transport savings that accrue to the government The GAO then decided to reexamine the costs sources said The issue is an important one because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp CCC almost equal costs department sources said USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage It was unclear whether the GAO Congress investigative arm would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs Reagan administration sources said The GAO is expected to point out that use of paymentinkind PIK certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates The CCC issues dollardenominated PIK certificates or certs as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash Between April and December 1986 CCC issued 38 billion dlrs worth of certificates according to USDA Up to another 67 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987 according to USDA Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate Eliminating this practice called PIK and roll would save the government 14 billion dlrs between 198892 according to the Congressional Budget Office CBO That estimate according to a CBO official was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIKandroll transactions among other savings alternatives The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs or between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays one administration official said However the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism department officials said The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year USDAs Economic Research Service for example has found that between June and August last year the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel Between September and November however certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices according to the ERS study obtained by Reuters Reuter 3

graincorn,Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the USUSSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States a Soviet trade official told Reuters How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices said Albert Melnikov deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States We are in the market for grains but it is up to the United States to be the seller to offer Soviets competitive prices he said in an interview Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow US grain at prevailing market prices We are being accused of not implementing this agreement We do not consider we are at fault Melnikov said Article I in the agreement states that purchasessales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchasesale and in accordance with normal commercial terms The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices Is the United States ready to supply this he said The Soviet official said that nearterm corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of US corn which he confirmed at 15 mln tonnes but said that if US corn prices remain competitive the Soviets will buy more if they need it Wheat buying however is a different story Melnikov said If the United States is interested in selling its wheat then they must offer competitive prices and its up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered he said Last years US offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy Melnikov said He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer US wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels Reuter 3

graincorn,Sen Tom Harkin DIowa defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said US farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 517 dlrs per bushel for wheat 377 dlrs for corn and 932 dlrs for soybeans all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions Present loan rates are 228 dlrs for wheat 192 for corn and effectively 456 for soybeans Also under the plan the US would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations to shareout export markets Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his Family Farm Act The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin US agricultural exports as critics claim but would increase overall revenue from exports This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices Sen Christopher Bond RMo countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers but he said high food prices stem more from gouging by food processing companies than from high farm product prices Harkin cited what he termed excessive net returns on equity over five years of 334 pct at Kellogg 319 pct Monfort 228 pct Nabisco 228 pct ConAgra 212 pct HJ Heinz 191 pct Ralston Purina 172 pct Pillsbury and 167 pct Quaker Oats Harkin said a legitimate concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers He said as a transition to the higher prices he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp grain stocks for three years Thereafter livestock farmers would benefit from a predictable and stable grain price he said Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more mandatory than the current farm program He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income Reuter 3

graincorn,US corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years Agriculture Department officials said USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 Agriculture Department analysts said next weeks figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres down 22 pct from last years plantings of 833 mln acres Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings US corn production will also decrease significantly Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program along with 19 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program will cause acreage to plummet Department feedgrain analysts said Theres no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage one said Its difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct USDA analysts said Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below they said compared to last years level of 615 mln acres If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in us corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the PaymentInKind program Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 42 billion bushels Given normal weather conditions this year USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels down from last years crop of 83 billion bushels This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production an analyst said A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual US corn usage so surplus stocks while not decreasing would not increase significantly a specialist said High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions based upon historical participation in government programs analysts said In contrast soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt a USDA soybean analyst said Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge he said Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higherproducing delta areas Soybean production could drop fractionally from last years 20 billion bushels to 18 to 19 billion he said US soybean acreage after soaring to 714 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that has steadily declined in the 1980s US corn acreage with the exception of 1983 has been in the low to mid 80mln acre range for the past 10 years The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 265 bushels per acre Last year US farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 1193 bushels per acre We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so an analyst said Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same analysts said Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres we would have to provide more incentives an analyst said Reuter 3

interestmoney-fx,US and UK bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry swap dealers said After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board dealers said that in effect regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine While no firm figures exist dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement Separately the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding Kenneth McCormick cochairman of the International Swap Dealers Association ISDA and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals What they are proposing is really double counting Patrick de SaintAignan managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co said Instead he argues banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value say one pct per year to maturity or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected said a director at one UK merchant bank What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now to borrow money now to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now he addedAdds title first paragraph Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement such as those based in Japan will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers Indeed regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the UKUS effort to draft new capital rules Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting that is offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other The paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements netting may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk Furthermore the paper said if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market So we dont know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court said one bank official Reuter 3
interestmoney-fx,Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling dashing hopes for an early cut in UK Base rates analysts said But the markets reaction testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish they agreed In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels specifying rates of around 190 marks and 160 dlrs Lawson added the UK Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these Markets were quick to react to the statement chopping about one US Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawsons statement signalled a change in UK Policy Keith Skeoch chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co said the remarks have been blown out of proportion Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellors statement He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate perhaps by as much as 10 pct It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election I dont believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate Brett said Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading This mood easily led to overreaction analysts said Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake one senior dealer with a US Bank said Capels Skeoch said it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at It is obvious that the government as a member of the Group of Six has agreed exchange rate bands But they are not cut in stone they can change with time Skeoch said Brett said we think the 290 marks level is a central rate Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks however Chris Dunn economist at Royal Bank of Canada said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar Although about twothirds of Britains trade is conducted with European countries sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark analysts noted Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the US Or throw in its lot with Europe Dunn said It suggests that while the UK Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System it is seeking protection by shadowing it The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the UK To clarify its position relative to the mark he said Analysts said sterlings dip on currency markets following Lawsons remarks made an early halfpoint cut in UK Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term Over the next three weeks a cut is out unless we get some extremely good economic indicators Capels Skeoch said Base rates have been cut twice by onehalf point in March the last after the March 17 budget presentation and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards REUTER 3

interestmoney-fx,Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets analysts said High shortterm interest rates a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months largely from Japanese and US Investors analysts polled by Reuters said Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile US Dollar instruments they said A one percentage point fall in key 10year bonds rates in the past month record share prices and a 10month high for the currency of 071 US Dlrs all illustrated the inflow Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they dont know what to do with it Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said There is a flight to quality Hamley said Australia may not be in the best economic position but there arent too many other countries where youd want to put your money The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the US Unit analysts said Were looking a more favoured market than perhaps the US Where some people would be concerned about the value of the US Dollar Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy he said It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy Buttrose said adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the governments promised tough economic statement on May 14 While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow particularly the Japanese who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said It will remain very edgy money If something was not to be delivered if the statement wasnt considered tough enough one might see a substantial outflow Buttrose said Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit analysts said They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here Buttrose said Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their eyes off the yen because of the crucial role of Japanese investors Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen Apart from its recovery against a weak US Dollar the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a tradeweighted basis in the last three weeks Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market It has followed Wall Street and other markets but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities particularly in the gold sector The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 17583 today nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986 while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 30810 in the same period The property sector is also sought after with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate particularly in the tourism field Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydneys fivestar Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought They think they find good value real estate here which with long term and fixed capital investment is the kind of investment Australia needs Buttrose added REUTER 3

interestmoney-fx,A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank encouraged by a strong guildermark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first Last month the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 51 pct from 525 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 355 pct from 38 pct That rate has remained in force just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings Given a strong guilder a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff forcing an official Dutch rate cut analysts said In February when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 35 pct the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota Since then however both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates In April Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 225 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 10010 pct for an effective yield of 598 pct the lowest since 1965 Technically analysts said there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate provided the guildermark relationship permitted The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112673 guilders per 100 marks Today foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112705 guilders per 100 at the fix a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands dealers said An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term However he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term In the Netherlands the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil or even negative while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation the ABN economist said He said Dutch money supply growth which ran at 34 pct in January could also contribute to some inflation At Amro Bank a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year The bank expects Dutch capital market rates currently averaging around 61 pct to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 56 pct Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down probably only temporarily while money rates could fall below five pct Currently all periods are traded at 512 to 525 pct in the money market REUTER 3
interestmoney-fx,Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies In a lecture at the University of Surrey prereleased here Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 180 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow To reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off In other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity Koehler said The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive US Current account deficit But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of US Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports But the volume effect of falling imports to the US And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term Koehler said A reduction in the US Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand In Japan and West Germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than GNP In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986 Koehler said If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the US Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the US But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the US When selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem A strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of noninflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions Koehler said Given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies Koehler said REUTER 3

interestmoney-fx,Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest twoweek statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period Wednesday borrowings were 14 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 645 pct One could make a case that the Fed is firming but it probably isnt said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the twoweeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months However the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest twoweek period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didnt quite make it said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net oneday miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday Still McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday the first two days of the week It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday Based on Fed data out today economists calculated that the twoday System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 59 billion dlrs They put Wednesdays overnight System repos at approximately 34 billion dlrs It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time said Larry Leuzzi of SG Warburg and Co Inc Citing the view shared by the other two economists Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterdays Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid In fact currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesdays G7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 618 pct This is about where the rate has been since early November Im not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said Sullivan of Dean Witter If it is however he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 625 to 635 pct from six to 610 pct previously Reuter 3
interestmoney-fx,Major US banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said In what was the first prime rate boost since mid1984 most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 734 pct citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money That spread has narrowed again A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc Brusca said a quarterpoint prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point He said that spread had averaged around 14 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co Weve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now said Harold Nathan economist at Wells Fargo Bank However he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift shortterm rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar He said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high a prime rate rise could occur at any time Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle US inflation As the dollar fell to a 40year low against the yen Friday currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar In addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the US currency would be for the Fed to push US interest rates higher relative to overseas rates Based particularly on the Feds reserve management actions on Friday and today Nathan of Wells Fargo said it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed Bank funding costs and other short and longterm interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected On Friday the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6516 pct With funds trading even higher at 612 pct today the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 15 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements The Feds actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said Jones of Lanston The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar Jones said He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have a major impact on the dollar the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from 512 pct Jones said a US discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar Given likely Fed policy firming he said both the yield on 30year Treasury bonds about 830 pct now and the prime rate may be at 812 pct at endJune and nine pct by years end The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said Leslie of Discount Corp He said taxdate pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy Reuter 3
interestmoney-fx,The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for US banks that takes into account the riskiness of a banks loans and other assets Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England The Fed set a 60day period for public comment on the plan The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments Previously the Fed Jan 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other offbalancesheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a banks minimum capital needs The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a banks current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure The current exposure would be measured by the marktomarket value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and US banking regulators Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity They ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of US banks to compete in world financial markets However the staff concluded The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 2025 largest participants in this market on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the UKUS effort to draft new capital rules Reuter 3

dlrmoney-fx,The dollars recent decline despite massive central bank purchases is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is welltimed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an evergrowing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention said Jim ONeill a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarterpoint to 734 pct the first change in the rate since last August the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 14750 yen up two yen from Tuesdays New York low By contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40year low Monday of 14470 yen Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar The market is wary of being caught wrongfooted by a central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized Theyve lost their credibility The market feels it can take on the central banks and win said Michael Snow head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22 1985 Plaza accord Then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances Now there is no such consensus The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the US trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries For its part the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability dealers say Specifically they said the Feds dollarbuying intervention has been halfhearted designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets Its been proforma intervention said Francoise SoaresKemp chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais Because of this discord and the markets momentum for a lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail Its going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar at these levels said Snow who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars added Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 170 marks analysts said Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely I dont think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies Indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market Trading volume in London New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day according to a joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group There are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered In this era of financial liberalization its almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan one senior official in Tokyo said Reuter 3

dlrmoney-fx,Pressure is growing in the financial markets for the US to take overt action to stabilize the dollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enough to help redress world trade imbalances economists and dealers said Some experts believe that a halfpoint increase in the US discount rate preferably in conjunction with rate cuts in Tokyo and Bonn would be enough to discourage sellers But many fear that more drastic action such as a US issue of yendenominated Treasury bonds may be needed Despite official warnings about the dangers of a further dollar decline and concerted central bank intervention the dollar extended its recent sharp depreciation touching a 40year low of 13725 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closing here on Friday at 1393040 The impact on other financial markets was devastating In Tokyo the stock market suffered its largest single day decline in London gold bullion prices rose to fouryear highs and in the US long Treasury bond yields surged above 880 pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40 points in hectic early trading The problem now is linkage This is not just a currency problem It is affecting all the markets said one senior trader at a major US bank Up until September of last year international efforts to redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a dream the dollar was falling in an orderly manner world interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check In recent months however this strategy has begun to show signs of severe stress with the US imposition of punitive tariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit of cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is really difficult to stop A US rate hike has become an inevitability one currency dealer said At this point nothing short of a Fed discount rate increase ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by Japan and Germany would seem capable of stabilizing the dollar said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co Inc Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 14 to 12 point US rate increase before May 19 and a rise in US bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 734 pct in the near future But many economists feared that any moderate US rate increases which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts overseas would be too little too late They should have done this 10 days ago It would have done the trick then said one currency analyst If they do it now it would be seen as a defensive measure not an offensive one It would show policy weakness not strength added one trader In addition economists fear that a discount rate rise might place additional strain on a sluggish US economy and tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate A US discount rate increase would also fuel the protectionist fires in Washington where the House is expected to pass a protectionist trade bill whatever compromises President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with during their summit later in the week Politically they cant really do it this week said one currency analyst pointing out that if it failed to stabilize the dollar it would only weaken the US negotiating stance Even if the US retains the upper hand economists and traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new initiatives from this weeks talks At best the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to outsiders while the US promises to lift its tariffs and support the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the markets speculative selling fervor which has now raised fears of weak overseas interest at next weeks quarterly US Treasury refunding program Japanese and European investors have traditionally played an active role in these auctions which are expected to total 28 to 29 billion dlrs Consequently thoughts are turning to the possibility that President Reagan may try to remove foreign investors worries about currency risk by financing part of the US budget deficit in yen or mark bonds rather than dollars While similar action by former President Carter helped to stabilize the dollar in 1978 the White House is clearly reluctant to take such a step economists said This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when US Treasury Secretary James Baker said there might well be some who would view yendenominated bonds as a lack of confidence by the US in its own currency Baker added therefore we dont think its an appropriate thing to do A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here shared Bakers doubts Dollar defending measures are very unlikely They will confirm the dollars

report economists at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co concluded the dollar should be left free to trade at whatever level market forces produce Reuter 3
dlrmoney-fx,The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth a top Bundesbank official said Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a mediumterm perspective He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability The Paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates Gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen Gleske said He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong and further falls there may still be necessary But a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value he said In fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers Gleske said First in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses Second in the United States it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits Gleske said Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts both within countries and between them For instance the US Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones If target zones were established this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities he said Gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities Commenting on the Paris currency accord Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained These chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot He said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible Monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said REUTER 3

grain,The Soviet Unions winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell author of the EF Hutton publication Global Crop News said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain possibly wheat from the US due to potential crop damage Compared with last year the outlook for the Soviet winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said But its still too early to talk about disastrous losses A lot will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 2535 pct of autumn precipitation she said The bitter winter cold temperatures which broke record lows that had stood for four decades also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops she said However she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover which should have wellinsulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986June 1987 marketing year primarily from Canada the European Community Argentina and Australia Martell said She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand Last falls dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisturedepleted pastures while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports However she said the US remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first US grain purchases of the 198687 season by buying 225 mln tonnes of corn Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the US is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand In 198485 the US supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 555 mln tonnes But in 198586 the Soviet Union bought 299 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the US for only 24 pct of that total While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 198687 was 22 mln tonnes many US grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 2528 mln tonnes she said Reuter 3

grain,A greater than anticipated need competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in US corn industry and government officials said As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 15 mln tonnes of US corn industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of US corn likely First there are supply concerns Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last years Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes rather than the 210 mln announced therby increasing the Soviet need for grain A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying an Agriculture Department source said Dry weather in Argentina a major corn supplier to the USSR and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 198687 corn crop estimate this week to 110 mln tonnes down from 115 mln Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500000 tonnes to 68 mln tonnes Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this years corn for export a USDA official said with two mln tonnes of that booked for AprilJune delivery to the USSR Significant downside potential still exists for the Argentine crop the official said which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period he said Current competitive prices for US corn have also sparked Soviet buying US corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne Argentine corn for 67 dlrs a very competitive price spread US and Soviet sources said This price difference makes American corn competitive Albert Melnikov commercial counselor for the Soviet Union told Reuters Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise and with the recently strong US corn futures prices the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy sources said Finally some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the USUSSR grains agreement four mln tonnes the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat In an inteview with Reuters this week USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer but that such an offer had not been ruled out Reuter 3

grain,Recent purchases of US corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels cash grain dealers said Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior which a dealer in Davenport Iowa said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed If the USDA acts soon as many dealers expect the movement would break the Gulf corn basis The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices one dealer said It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest But we dont know when they might do it an Ohio dealer said which has created uncertainty in the market The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage Yesterday USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 385 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers in lieu of cash payments had to date been exchanged for grain With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices cash grain dealers said A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals cash dealers said Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price The mild winter and early reopening of the midMississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight dealers noted The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings they said The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 40 mln tonnes of US corn one Midwest cash grain trader said But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system Reuter 3

grain,Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 1040 mln hectares in 198788 from 1172 mln sown in 198687 Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd AWF said in its first preliminary crop forecast But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 198788 would be less than the 165 mln tonnes of last year the private forecaster said as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks it said The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost credit and yield pressures But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average AWF said Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers income AWF said AWFs state area forecasts in mln hectares with 198687 production in mln tonnes are as follows crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year Area Crop 198788 198687 198687 Queensland 082 082 095 NSW 307 317 440 Victoria 153 163 325 SAustralia 145 164 230 WAustralia 353 446 560 REUTER 3

grain,The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant The onetime pilot 092 program designed to assist farmers in Kansas Oklahoma Michigan and parts of Missouri was passed by a 304100 vote and sent to the Senate Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 092 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration the US Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administrations proposed broadscale revision of farm programs The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received To be eligible winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs largely because of reduced crop forfeitures The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last falls flooding In addition the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall Currently because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses The administration said it opposed the bill because by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance USDA also said the 092 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administrations proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings USDA said the 092 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs while the requirement to compensate fully disasterstruck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs which must be appropriated by Congress The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments But the Senate bill would not offer the 092 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program Reuter 3

grain,The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Parisbased Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies Results of the study which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 197981 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent PSE The study shows that on dairy products Japans PSE or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged 833 pct over 197981 with the European Community at 688 pct and the United States 482 pct For wheat Japans PSE averaged 958 pct the EC 281 and the US 172 Japans rice PSE was 688 pct compared to the EC 136 and the US 54 pct the OECD calculations show In coarse grains Japans subsidies reached 1071 pct compared with 279 pct for the EC and 131 pct for the US Japans beef subsidy was 549 pct versus 527 pct for the EC and 95 pct for the US OECD concluded For sugar Japans PSE was 484 pct versus 279 pct in the EC and 131 pct for the US the study shows The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the US EC and Japan the sources said Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD work Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture However the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said The US Agriculture Departments Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 198284 In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECDs in part because farm policies in both the US and elsewhere had changed markedly by 198284 from the OECD base period of 197981 US officials said For example the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 198284 at 25 to 49 pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the US now because of increases since 1984 Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation The updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in US subsidy levels for sugar because the US imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry US subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials added Reuter 3

grain,Sharp cuts this year in US planted acreage may not make a big dent in the US grain stockpile but will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing Agriculture Department and industry commodity analysts said The scenario is turning around on stocks The whole supplydemand picture could finally be getting more in balance a USDA analyst said The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated that US farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual acreage reduction programs this year An additional 20 mln acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program bringing total idled acreage in the US to 7275 mln acres almost a third of the nations total 235 mln acre crop base Production of wheat corn and soybeans in 198687 will probably closely match annual usage limiting any buildup in stocks analysts said Its a substantially different story from last year when we added 15 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile Vernon McMinimy director of commodity research for Staley Co said Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here McMinimy said that 676 mln planted acres of corn will likely translate into 60 mln harvested acres and with normal yields final production of 69 to 70 billion bushels McMinimy estimated that total US corn disappearance in 198687 could end up at 71 billion bushels possibly resulting in a 200million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile of 545 billion bushels To say this represents a turnaround is wrong but were at least in a holding pattern George Hoffman director of commodity analysis for Pillsbury said Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of 198687 to 19 billion bushels due to significantly less domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices USDA analysts however project slightly higher usage and said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not increase With yearly use at around two billion bushels next years projected crop could be used up an analyst said We wont be adding to stocks Stocks are at a record now so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage reductions that would be an improvement an Agriculture Department wheat analyst said Soybean planted acreage at 569 mln acres would be the smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to 100 mln bushels analysts said As more marginal erodable acreage is enrolled in the conservation reserve program annual acreage reduction programs will be more effective because they will force more high producing land out of production a USDA analyst said We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long tunnel the analyst said Reuter 3

grain,Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the International Wheat Council IWC says in its latest monthly report Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the United States the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters Argentina Australia Canada the EC and the US In some countries for example Australia and Argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated Alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for a long period This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency For example between 198586 and 198687 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 20930 to 17944 European currency units Ecus It dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 This was partly due to increased production in China and India The period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the Argentina the US And Australia by lower acreages In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower US Acreages are attributed to official incentives REUTER 3

grain,Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito speaking from Brasilia told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed The states of Sao Paulo Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production The biggest problems are concentrated in the CentreWest growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity Brito said the CentreWest whose crops include soya and maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space In addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain Brito said Finally there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries Reuter 3

grain,A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain coresponsibility levy is applied a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association Het Comite told Reuters Het Comite has been coordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and since December has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency crossrates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10 The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged because the bill the firm received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins The name of the company is not being made public The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg and as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved Meanwhile the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected the spokesman said Het Comite as a member of FEFAC the association of European animal feed manufacturers is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court Reuter 3

oilseedsoybean,Several leading farmstate Congressmen said they will press the US Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing chairman Dan Glickman DKan proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks Lets see if we can try to push them USDA to do something without legislation Glickman told the hearing The current soybean loan rate effectively is 456 dlrs per bushel with no income protection or marketing loan David Haggard American Soybean Association ASA president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program The current soybean program gave us the worst of both worlds ASAs Haggard told the hearing The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America he said At the same time the US soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers Haggard said We need some kind of market loan he added The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a dilemna which has been studied extensively by the department But he did not say what if any changes are under consideration In his testimony Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers such as a socalled producer option payment or a direct payment program Haggard said barring any program changes Commodity Credit Corporation CCC soybean stocks now at 385 mln bu will rise to 500 mln by the end of August A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and endyear Thus CCC could own the equivalent of Brazils entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987 Haggard said However Haggard said that the US should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the US program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT He noted that The EC imports one quarter of US soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating The Reagan administration has given mixed signals on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC Haggard said While the ASA position is to support a 502 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep Jerry Huckaby DLa which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee Rep Edward Madigan of Illinois Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 15 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan the US soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered Reuter 3

oilseedsoybean,Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agricultures annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 85 mln tonnes down from 91 mln tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 334 mln tonnes up from 330 mln last year and disappearance at 340 mln tonnes up from 326 mln Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600000 tonnes the largest deficit since 1976 If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the crush of soybeans the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop he said This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds Balletto said Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies he said World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 284 mln tonnes compared with 254 mln last year The increase should result from lower disappearance as production is expected to fall to 1840 mln tonnes from 1857 mln last year he said World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 989 mln tonnes up from 906 mln the previous year Balletto said while production of other oilseeds was lower Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States he said Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and US stocks make up most of those Balletto said The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 127 mln tonnes about half of the world soybean surplus he said Since 198384 he said world oilseed stocks have increased 131 mln tonnes During the same period US soybean stocks increased 121 mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the US loan program Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long as the US soybean surplus continues For the 1987 crop he said prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the US loan program Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the US loan rate The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said Reuter 3

veg-oil,A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax Norbert Tanghe head of division of the Commissions Directorate General for Agriculture told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable Tanghe said Recent estimates put these costs at 40 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 20 billion Ecus he said In 1990 the Communitys standstill agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system he added Under the Commissions system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced Tanghe said Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policys oils and fats regime The Commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal he said Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT rules It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats ECproduced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements he said The competitiveness between different oils whether EC produced or imported would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax Tanghe said The proposed system would not alter the EC nations requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand he said It is one of the proposals objectives to maintain current import levels he said Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ECs cakes and meals requirements which are not covered by the stabilising system Furthermore more than half the oil produced from imported beans is reexported to third countries Tanghe added Reuter 3

pet-chem,Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened US dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined US petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp <GAF> privatelyheld Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH> the Kentuckybased oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for moneymaking petrochemical businesses to buy I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW> adding Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year US petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history In 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong US dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it Oreffice said GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the US chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 Last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985 The turn in the fortunes of the oncesickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Paces John Dosher Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies That helped boost US chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s Finally virtually all major US chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp <UK> recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp <BOR> a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals Another industry powerhouse WR Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are customdesigned for a small group of buyers Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated Dosher said But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market Some top chemical executives share the concern The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes GAFs Heyman cautioned The shift from commodity chemicals may be illadvised Specialty businesses do not stay special long Houstonbased Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business

products This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous highmargin business Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually Garo Armen an analyst with

money-fxdlr,USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the US dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the US trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit Roderick said There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery Roderick said the US should be understanding of the economic pain our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar But he added As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations At the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the US exceeded the value of US assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the US had a surplus in assets of 141 billion A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved Roderick said But it is wrong he said to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of US productivity or of American product quality These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem Roderick said He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets In the speech the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators Among his proposals which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week were a requirement that raiders give 24hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made Further raiders should be required to make an allcash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target companys stock he said And payment of greenmail or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raiders stake should be prohibited under the revised laws Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage fair price to all takeovers Reuter 3

money-fxdlr,A leading US Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels Kurt Viermetz Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co> told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in US Deficits on a lasting basis Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround rise in the dollar Viermetz said I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987 The United States West Germany Japan France Great Britain and Canada G6 agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels The accord came after months of transatlantic argument with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washingtons policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances But Viermetz said Morgan Guarantys economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan the US Trade deficit would improve only temporarily He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990 it would be back around 160 billion dlrs This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington he said Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord struck when the dollar was trading at about 183 marks and 15250 yen Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or Plaza Accord the dollar had been trading at 284 marks and 240 yen Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a loose range of 175 to 190 marks and 145 to 155 yen with any attempt to push the US Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 1471525 yen its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years It closed at 1816070 marks Viermetz also said he did not see the US Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar But at the same time worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 634 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and US Financial centres Formal discussions which end today have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of business Hikmat Nashashibi President of the Arab Bankers Association said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking REUTER 3

nat-gas,Demand for natural gas has failed to grow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because of concerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the United States said industry analysts and gas utility company sources Natural gas is not free to compete said Larry Makovich director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc problems on pipeline open access and takeorpay liabilities still weigh heavily on endusers decision to switch to natural gas A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company agreed that reluctance among endusers often stemmed from fear of unresolved regulatory issues The fact that at the federal level open access is not yet firmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gas from producers to consumers he said Michael German an economist with the American Gas Association said while a significant amount of gas was now replacing oil in dualfuel boilers the progress of expanding the marketshare of gas was slow First quarter natural gas consumption data is not available until June In the first three months of 1987 residual fuel demand fell by an average of 55000 barrels per day according to the American Petroleum Institute Natural gas however was not able to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption AGAs German said that while industrial consumers were concerned with regulatory issues in their longrange capital investment decisions in the dualfuel boiler market relied on spot purchases With all the capability of switching from oil to natural gas already there price of the fuel is the only concern he said adding that compared with the same period last year January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for industrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas to lower demand in the utility sector as a whole March was warmer than normal which cut down gas consumption not only in home heating but also in electricity generation he said In March according to API monthly statistics residual fuel deliveries fell by 136 pct to 12 mln barrels per day from the same period a year ago While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices had put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric utilities and industrial users industry analysts believed the role of natural gas was overstated Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the fuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream in the last few years Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986 and he projected the same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988 In contrast oil and gas together represented only 15 pct of the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989 he said Within this sector gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986 from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil prices he added But this year gas was expected to recapture only two pct of the share Makovich said Michael German of AGA agreed and said Nevertheless outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is significant in a glutted market Reuter 3

money-supply,Central bank money stock was growing at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987 down from 912 pct in the second half of 1986 so there are signs that the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above target the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for central bank money stock In the previous year it grew 77 pct outside the 312 to 512 pct target range The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was limited by a series of external factors These included the revaluation of the mark growing foreign payments surpluses of nonbanks and currency inflows The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot in 1986 as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward pressure on the mark it said The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were invested in longterm bank accounts or bonds public bonds or foreign securities the Bundesbank said But if companies and private households continue to hold their funds in liquid forms or if there are further currency inflows growth will be closer to the upper end of the range The more the conflict between external constraints and domestic objectives relaxes and many things point to this at the time of writing this report the more possible it will be to do justice again to the mediumterm concept of money supply control the Bundesbank said It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again at the start of 1987 There would be virtually no easing of other production costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unitwage costs Nevertheless no inflationary trends are likely to set in this year the Bundesbank said A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying price rises can only be observed in the long term it added The continuing trend for nonbanks to switch into longterm borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates while for the same reason shunning longterm investments increases the risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing themselves with variableinterest deposits it added REUTER 3
money-supply,Robert Heller a member of the Federal Reserve Board said he expects more modest levels of growth in the money supply this year In my view this would not only be a logical but also a most desireable development he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange Calif A text was released in Washington He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished Consequently monetary growth may return to more modest levels Heller said He noted growth in the money supply slowed after midJanuary I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well he added Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future he said Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector and might not gain more market share for US producers A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern Heller warned He said we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets Heller said He said the US economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987 aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country Heller said Reuter 3

money-supply,US money supply growth is slowing down rapidly and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserves main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy M1 money supply for the week ended February 23 reported today rose 19 billion dlrs to 7385 billion but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs The monthly average in January was 7371 billion dlrs M1 makes up about a quarter of M2 and a fifth of M3 With other components of M2 such as moneymarket deposit accounts and small time deposits also falling the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too economists say M1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when theyre all sending the same signal This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed McCarthy said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added We have some very goodlooking monetary aggregate data Its coming in a lot weaker than I thought The economists were quick to caution that one months data prove nothing especially because money growth previously had been so rapid M1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 167 pct rate and at a 191 pct rate in the past 13 weeks Moreover some of the contraction in M2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago he noted He expects only five to six pct M1 growth in March and rises in M2 and M3 of about four pct Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M1 and five pct or less for M2 and M3 but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak Youd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance sheet however to suggest a change of policy is already under way economists said Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve Americas most urgent economic problem its massive trade deficit Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation and thus rising inflation may be needed to close the trade gap Brusca said Im not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market Reuter 3

money-supply,Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy Mueller a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria noted that the Bundesbanks decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy he explained Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down Lower money market rates achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials also encouraged investors to reinvest funds parked in liquid accounts Mueller said The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path he said Finally of course and there is no need to keep this quiet the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months he added All in all the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut despite suppositions to the contrary Mueller said Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad rather than growth in bank credits is the cause of rising monetary holdings of nonbanks Mueller said Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific markdollar exchange rate In any case the exchange rate partly depends on US Currency and budgetary policy and the US Economy he said But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbanks considerations but reflect competition and other market conditions Mueller said A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock the Bundesbanks main money supply indicator This does not reflect banking liquidity but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbanks instruments Mueller said The less dependent nonbanks are on bank credits the harder it is to steer money supply This has increasingly been the case recently because nonbanks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows he said Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct down from 10 pct in the previous quarter The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth pointing to the success of the current policy he said But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy nothing else he said REUTER 3

crudenat-gas,Exxon Corp said in its annual report that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace all oil and gas produced The company said that it added about four pct to production bringing it to 18 mln bpd the highest level since 1979 based largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not replace all of the oil and gas produced The company said that the average price for oil and gas declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38 pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production Exxons earnings from exploration and production in 1986 fell to 31 billion dlrs from 49 billion dlrs in 1985 Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from the Gulf of Mexico Alaska the North Sea Malaysia and from oil sands in Canada Exxon also said that it acquired 112 mln acres for expoloration spread over 10 countries including the US Europe and the Far East But capital expenditures for exploration and production were cut to 46 billion dlrs from 76 billion the previous year and further reductions were expected in 1987 Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached a new high of 422000 bpd The light sweet crudes produced from these North Sea fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper lower quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded over the past several years The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to earnings gains from refining and marketing Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986 up from 872 mln dlrs in 1985 The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4043 mln barrels per day from 4082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs rose to 30 mln bpd from 29 mln bpd the previous year Exxons refinery operations benefited from a three year 500 mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown Texas refinery completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes to extract higher proportions of light products Reuter 3

crudenat-gas,A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administrations controversial offshore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment The administration said that the courtordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 42 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980 A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration Here injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable Justice Byron White wrote for the court And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined he said The oil companies Amoco Corp <AN> ARCO Exxon Corp <XON> Mobil Corp <MOB> Sohio Shell Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses The first lease sale in 1983 involved 24 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs Administration officials saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing Reuter 3
crudenat-gas,US Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means to stimulate domestic oil and gas production I am an advocate for incentives for exploration Hodel said but added I do not favor an oil import fee It would inject the federal government so deeply back in to the process we would never get the government out again and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of the nation Hodel said in an address to a group of local business executives Earlier today Congressmen from oil producing states introduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports Hodel said he supports drilling incentives such as repeal of the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulation of natural gas The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshore California and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge is necessary to prevent the US from becoming too dependent on foreign supplies of oil for its energy needs Failure to approve such exploration Hodel said would lead to greater US dependence on foreign sources of oil In the next two to five years no matter what we do today we are very likely to find the US becoming 50 pct or more dependent on imports for its oil requirements Hodel said If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply Congress would likely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices and allocate supplies Hodel said If they allocate supplies you and I in the same twotofive year time frame could well find ourselves sitting back in gas lines Hodel said Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize environmentally sensitive areas Hodel said We are convinced we can meet and resolve every environmental concern that is raised Hodel said Reuter 3

crudenat-gas,The worlds dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it Donald K McIvor an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview NonOPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable McIvor said Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence McIvor said McIvor Exxons senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideasts large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding Since 1970 weve been consuming oil at rates of 2025 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 1015 bilion barrels per year McIvor said The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity he added McIvor said that of the some 30000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 oneone thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered McIvor said in response to a question that he did not believe there were any more super giants or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels to be found which would change the conclusion of the worlds growing dependency Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east Cantarell in Mexico and Alaskas North Slope McIvor said McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the US like Alaskas Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east particulartly in Canada the North Sea and Australia and Africa McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies McIvor said McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy Asked about the options offered this week by US Energy Secretary Herrington to increase US production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but the thrust of his Herrington report is valid It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase US production McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkds energy supply McIvor said Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat as an industrial fuel he added Reuter 3

crudenat-gas,The US Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices and the subsequent growth in oil imports industry analysts said The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better said Daniel Yergin director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates which recently completed a survey of the US Congress on energy issues Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee Today US Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed Herrington said I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day addition to US production US oil output was off to 84 mln bpd in the week of March 13 down six pct from last year the American Petroleum Institute said Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term Paul Mlotok oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that even with the rise in prices for the last week or two weve only altered our average price scenerio to about 1750 dlrs for the year Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in US crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration John Lichtblau president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said The continuing decline in US oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and US government policy Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time Lowering the producing industrys tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant to output than a price increase but would not raise energy costs Lichtblau said But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the US are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee Ronald Tappmeyer president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors said The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation The association represents some 1300 drilling and oil service companies The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman Orval Hansen showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of US requirements is a critical symbolic level If they imports move above that level a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action But Lichtblau in a telephone interview said a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990 In 1986 US oil imports rose to 33 pct of us energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987 he added Reuter 3
crudenat-gas,Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost US oil production but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 275 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year The White House reacting said it did not favor amending the tax code but would look at the proposal Herringtons proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy departments report on energy and the national security The report said US oil imports rapidly rising could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteriaincrease production not cause economic dislocation and be low cost to the taxpayer Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test spurring production but fail the second and third He said it would raise production and return 120000 oil workers to their jobs but at the same time it lifted oil prices the higher prices would cost 400000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs A tax on gasoline he said would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production In any case US officials say President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax Options which meet Herringtons criteria include Loanprice guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs A five pct tax credit for exploration and development It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325000 barrels a day at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures It would increase production by 80000 barrels a day at a cost of 65 mln dlrs Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144000 dlrs Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300000 barrels daily He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge which may hold nine billion barrels Herrington said he understood the Reagans reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals but added he hoped his departments energysecurity study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry Another move Herrington said he will press anew even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House is to raise the fillrate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35000 This he said would further bolster national security in case of an oilsupply disruption Reuter 3
crudenat-gas,A Soviet geologist said scientists need to coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits to help identify global formations that would indicate other potential discoveries of oil and gas reserves Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich the head of petroleum geology at Moscow State University told delegates at the World Petroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also be improved through new and more sophisticated technology We should emphasize that when having the data about petroleum distribution onshore and offshore it is possible to clarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gas prospects Semenovich said However much work should be done to coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gas prospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins Sharing the information could help geologists better predict regional trends and underground formations that indicate the presence of oil or gas he said Semenovich also said that existing estimates of the potential oil and natural gas resources of the world may need to be revised upward as oil companies continue to examine unexplored regions The world which has already produced 476 billion barrels of oil and gas has a current total of about 733 billion barrels in proved reserves Undiscovered resources are estimated at about 14 trillion barrels or about half of the total ultimate reserves Semenovich said There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the world and as far as the already known basins one continues to find additional reserves he said noting that Antarctica has been virtually ignored The existing estimate of potential resources of the world may need to be enlarged To find deeper and more expensive reserves scientists will need to use 3D mapping of underground formations and laser spectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among other techniques he said He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13 pct of all offshore reserves Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oil and gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would be discovered and placed in production during the next 50 years After his speech Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil production was increasing The difficulties of 1985 have been overcome and were now back to normal production he said The Soviet Union the worlds largest producer of oil had experienced drilling and technical problems that cut total liquids production from 1245 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 121 mln barrels a day in 1985 Last year the Soviets produced an estimated 123 mln barrels When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal gasification project in Soviet Central Asia Semenovich said the project was important because of the lack of oil reserves in the region Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil prices the coal gasification process would become economic again Its too expensive for the time being Semenovich said Theoretical development is underway and tests are being run For the moment coal gasification is a very small part of the energy industry he said Reuter 3
crudenat-gas,The drastic cutbacks in US drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United States natural gas bubble which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch industry analysts said Faltering deliverability of natural gas a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities could more than double the current US rig count to near 2000 by 1990 some analysts said The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexicos offshore waters where some of the nations largest gas reserves are located We think an upturn in US drilling is imminent said James Crandall an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because theyre betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last years plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that Todays relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the US drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count a barometer of the oil industrys health showed 761 US rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year In 1986 the Hughes rig count began the year at 1915 but dived to a postWorld War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times Ike Kerridge a Hughes economist said In 1986 the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate wont be any better this year He added We dont have the options we do with oil Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while US consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet according to industry estimates George Gaspar an oil analyst with Robert W Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in US drilling We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid1988 Gaspar said Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2000 in December of 1989 Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years Some of the industrys biggest companies such as Exxon Corp <XON> Mobil Corp MOB and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico Crandall said For example Conoco Inc a Dupont <DD> subsidiary will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexicos deepest production platform which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day But T Boone Pickens who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in recent months is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery Pickens predicts the US rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do The rigs wont go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel said Pickens 58 adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2000 again in his lifetime Tenneco Inc <TGT> one of the largest US gas producers is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the US gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years supply Current spot market prices of about 150 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement he said Reuter 3

crudenat-gas,Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound European energy companies are buying up cheap US oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies oil industry analysts said They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages However the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms wellheeled US institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties Strevig and Associates a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher All buyers of US reserves paid a median price of 645 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions up from 533 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter according to the firms research Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time but were seeing new names and smaller companies coming in said Arthur Smith an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S Herold Inc in Greenwich Conn Europeans especially do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries he added Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the US dollar the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them Plenty of properties are available on the market thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch In two of the biggest transactions of recent months Frenchowned Minatome Corp a unit of <Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles> spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP> A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions A partnership of two Belgianowned firms <Petrofina SA> and <Cometra Oil SA> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB> the Oklahoma pipeline firm But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced US companies to explore for new oil Japans <Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Incs <TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs US drilling program and has joined with Duponts <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal Most buyers said the payback period of a property its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple priceperbarrel formula Rich Hodges a Houstonbased land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp a partnership of <Preussag Corp> and <C Deilmann Inc> of West Germany said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions PaineWebbers Geodyne Energy Income Fund for example has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties The competition is stiff not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and US oil companies he said Our company is shopping around because we feel its substantially less risky than pure exploration If youre going to take the risk inherent in exploration you need prices higher than the current market he added In addition to the foreign investors and US brokerage houses analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties Houstonbased Shell Oil Co a unit of Royal DutchShell Group <RD> has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves Smith said Since 1982 Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 280 dlrs a barrel he said Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies Smith said Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988 Reuter 3
